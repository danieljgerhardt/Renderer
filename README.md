This is going to be my pet renderer. It was initially built off a DX12 base I wrote for a project called Breakpoint. I am going to gut the "Breakpoint" part of the project and start building a renderer out of it, to keep my programming and graphics knowledge up.

List of goals:
- [ ] Remove Breakpoint files
- [ ] Add GLTF importing
- [ ] Add environment mapping
- [ ] Add PBR support for rasterization
- [ ] Update IMGUI to be useful for the renderer
- [ ] Add path tracing mode
