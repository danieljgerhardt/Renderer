This is going to be my pet renderer. It was initially built off a DX12 base I wrote for a project called Breakpoint. I am going to gut the "Breakpoint" part of the project and start building a renderer out of it, to keep my programming and graphics knowledge up.

List of goals:
- [x] Remove Breakpoint files
- [x] Rename sln
- [x] Rework scene organization to actually make sense
- [x] Add GLTF importing
- [x] Add texture/material support
- [ ] Add resource manager
- [ ] Add DGR namespace wrapper
- [ ] Refactor main + ImGUI for neater code
- [ ] Add environment mapping
- [ ] Add rasterized PBR support
- [ ] Add skinning
- [ ] Add path tracing with DXR
- [ ] Use render graph
- [ ] Add SSR and deferred rendering for rasterized PBR
- [ ] Support multiple lights with forward, clustered, etc.
