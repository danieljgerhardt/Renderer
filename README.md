This is going to be my pet renderer. It was initially built off a DX12 base I wrote for a project called Breakpoint. I am going to gut the "Breakpoint" part of the project and start building a renderer out of it, to keep my programming and graphics knowledge up.

List of goals:
- [x] Remove Breakpoint files
- [x] Rename sln
- [x] Rework scene organization to actually make sense
- [ ] Abstract DX repeated logic(fences, etc.)
- [x] Add GLTF importing
- [ ] Add texture/material support
- [ ] Add environment mapping
- [ ] Add skinning
- [ ] Add PBR support for rasterization
- [ ] Update IMGUI to be useful for the renderer
- [ ] Add path tracing mode
